# PORTFOLIO YAIZA SORIA FELICES

My name is Yaiza.

I am a junior front-end developer and this is my portfolio.

I am a person with a great capacity for adaptation, autonomy and self-taught.

Capable of facing challenging situations and overcoming challenges.

Wishing to have my first opportunity as a junior web programmer, and to be able to continue learning and putting into practice all my knowledge.
